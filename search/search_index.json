We will be using the Cloud9 IDE and a combination of python code and AWS console access for these workshops. Ubiquitous Encryption Data encryption provides a strong layer of security to protect data that you store within AWS services. AWS services can help you achieve ubiquitous encryption for data in transit as well as data at rest. Prerequisites AWS Account In order to complete these workshops you'll need a valid active AWS Account with Admin permissions. The code and instructions in these workshops assume only one student is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another student, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. Use a personal account or create a new AWS account to ensure you have the neccessary access. This should not be an AWS account from the company you work for. If the resources that you use for this workshop are left undeleted you will incur charges on your AWS account. Browser These workshops assume that you are using a Cloud IDE environment. We recommend you use the latest version of Chrome or Firefox to complete this workshop. Knowledge Of Python Programming Language Basic python knowledge is sufficient to consume these workshops. Region Support Since these workshops use the Cloud9 IDE, you can use run these workshops in the following regions where the AWS Cloud9 service is available : N.Virginia, Ohio, Oregon, Ireland and Singapore. Cloudformation templates for initial environment setup Please run these cloudformation stacks in your AWS account as this is required for all the workshops in this repository. When you launch the Cloudformation stack keep clicking next until you get to the point where it says \"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.\" Acknowledge the above statement by clicking on the check box and then click on the Create button Step 1 : (Launch CF Stack) The above stack creates an Cloud9 IDE environment called workshop-environment . In addition a VPC with two subnets and an internet gateway is also created. Step 2 : (Cloud9 IDE Environment Setup) Navigate to the Cloud9 service within your AWS console Open the Cloud9 IDE environment called workshop-environment .It takes about 30 seconds for the environment to start up. In the Cloud9 IDE environment you will find a folder called data-protection in the folder pane on the left side of the screen Open the file named environment-setup.py in the IDE Run the python module environment-setup.py by clicking the play button on the top pane This module would take about a minute to complete In the runner window below you should see Workshop environment setup was successful printed Step 3 : (Initiating CF stacks creation) Within the Cloud9 environment, open the file named cf-setup.py in the IDE Run the python module cf-setup.py by clicking the play button on the top pane In the runner window below you should see All cloudformation stack creation for the workshops has been initiated printed It takes about 5 minutes for all cloudformation stacks creation to complete. Once complete you should see the following stacks successfully completed as shown in the picture below : Step 3 : (Change directory) Open a bash terminal within the Cloud9 environment and change directory to data-protection . See Images below At this point the cloud9 environment is ready for the workshops Workshops Please review and complete all the above prerequisites before attempting these workshops. The images below are clickable links Final Cleanup Once you you have finished working on the workshops within this repository ,the final step is to clean up the resources by deleting the cloudformation stacks that setup the workshop environment. For cleanup follow the steps below : Step 1 : Within the Cloud9 IDE workshop environment that you used for this workshop checkout the final clean up branch by using the following command : git checkout final-cleanup Step 2 : In the Cloud9 IDE you will find a python module called final-cleanup.py Run the final-cleanup.py python module At this point, cleanup of the cloudformation stacks is initiated. It takes about 10 minutes for all the cloudformation stacks to be deleted. Please make sure that you don't close this browser window until all the cloudformation stacks are deleted The Cloud9 IDE workshop environment session shall will be terminated at this point License Summary This sample code is made available under a modified MIT license.
